# Building AI Applications with Haystack

Welcome to the **Building AI Applications with Haystack** project! This repository showcases how to create powerful, production-ready AI applications for search, question answering, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/).

## 📚 Project Overview
Haystack is an open-source framework designed for developing NLP-based pipelines quickly and efficiently. This project demonstrates:

- Document indexing and retrieval
- Question answering over documents
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Building custom pipelines for search and knowledge extraction

## 🚀 Features
- End-to-end pipeline setup with Haystack
- Integration with LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face models)
- Elasticsearch, FAISS, or Weaviate vector database options
- Modular design: retrievers, readers, generators
- FastAPI-based minimal backend for serving models

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Haystack** (Core NLP framework)
- **Python** (Backend development)
- **FastAPI** (Optional API layer)
- **Elasticsearch / FAISS** (Vector databases)
- **Docker** (Containerization, optional)
